## About Hats Audit Competition


Hats Audit Competitions offer a unique and decentralized approach to enhancing the security of web3 projects. Leveraging the large collective expertise of hundreds of skilled auditors, these competitions foster a proactive bug hunting environment to fortify projects before their launch. Unlike traditional security assessments, Hats Audit Competitions operate on a time-based and results-driven model, ensuring that only successful auditors are rewarded for their contributions. This pay-for-results ethos not only allocates budgets more efficiently by paying exclusively for identified vulnerabilities but also retains funds if no issues are discovered. With a streamlined evaluation process, Hats prioritizes quality over quantity by rewarding the first submitter of a vulnerability, thus eliminating duplicate efforts and attracting top talent in web3 auditing. The process embodies Hats Finance's commitment to reducing fees, maintaining project control, and promoting high-quality security assessments, setting a new standard for decentralized security in the web3 space​​.
